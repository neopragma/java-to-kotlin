# Starter code - Java with TestNG and Mockito

The code base contains a subset of functionality that would be present in a point of sale application. It has classes to represent a Stock Knowledge Unit, a Transaction, and Line Items for a transaction. There are several unit tests and one integration test. 

There isn't enough code to do anything real, but there's enough to demonstrate that we can approach a Java-to-Kotlin conversion incrementally, with the existing test suite helping us catch any mistakes we might make.
